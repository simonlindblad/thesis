Supervised machine learning models require a labeled data set of high quality in order to perform well.
Available text data often exists in abundance, but it is usually not labeled.
Labeling text data is a time consuming process, especially in the case where multiple labels can be assigned to a single text document.
The purpose of this thesis was to make the labeling process of clinical reports as effective and effortless as possible by evaluating different multi-label active learning strategies.
The goal of the strategies was to reduce the number of labeled documents a model needs, and increase the quality of those documents.
With the strategies, an accuracy of 89\% was achieved with 2500 reports, compared to 85\% with random sampling.
In addition to this, 85\% accuracy could be reached after labeling 975 reports, compared to 1700 reports with random sampling.
