Supervised machine learning models require a high quality set of labeled data in order to perform well.
Available text data often exists in abundance, but it is usually not labeled.
Labeling text data is a time consuming process, especially in the case where multiple labels can be assigned to a single text document.
The purpose of this thesis was to make the labeling process of clinical reports as effective and effortless as possible by evaluating different multi-label active learning strategies.
By using one of these strategies the goal was to reduce the number of labeled documents needed, and increase the quality of those that are.
With the strategies, an accuracy of 89\% was achieved with 2500 reports, compared to 85\% with random sampling.
In addition to this, 85\% accuracy could be reached after labeling 975 reports, compared to 1700 reports with random sampling.
