\chapter{Discussion}
\label{cha:discussion}

%This chapter contains the following sub-headings.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:discussion-results}

%Are there anything in the results that stand out and need be
%analyzed and commented on? How do the results relate to the
%material covered in the theory chapter? What does the theory
%imply about the meaning of the results? For example, what
%does it mean that a certain system got a certain numeric value
%in a usability evaluation; how good or bad is it? Is there
%something in the results that is unexpected based on the
%literature review, or is everything as one would theoretically
%expect?

\section{Method}
\label{sec:discussion-method}

%GThis is where the applied method is discussed and criticized.
%GTaking a self-critical stance to the method used is an
%Gimportant part of the scientific approach.
%G
%GA study is rarely perfect. There are almost always things one
%Gcould have done differently if the study could be repeated or
%Gwith extra resources. Go through the most important
%Glimitations with your method and discuss potential
%Gconsequences for the results. Connect back to the method
%Gtheory presented in the theory chapter. Refer explicitly to
%Grelevant sources.
%G
%GThe discussion shall also demonstrate an awareness of methodological
%Gconcepts such as replicability, reliability, and validity. The concept
%Gof replicability has already been discussed in the Method chapter
%G(\ref{cha:method}). Reliability is a term for whether one can expect
%Gto get the same results if a study is repeated with the same method. A
%Gstudy with a high degree of reliability has a large probability of
%Gleading to similar results if repeated. The concept of validity is,
%Gsomewhat simplified, concerned with whether a performed measurement
%Gactually measures what one thinks is being measured. A study with a
%Ghigh degree of validity thus has a high level of credibility. A
%Gdiscussion of these concepts must be transferred to the actual context
%Gof the study.
%G
%GThe method discussion shall also contain a paragraph of
%Gsource criticism. This is where the authorsâ€™ point of view on
%Gthe use and selection of sources is described.
%G
%GIn certain contexts it may be the case that the most relevant
%Ginformation for the study is not to be found in scientific
%Gliterature but rather with individual software developers and
%Gopen source projects. It must then be clearly stated that
%Gefforts have been made to gain access to this information,
%Ge.g. by direct communication with developers and/or through
%Gdiscussion forums, etc. Efforts must also be made to indicate
%Gthe lack of relevant research literature. The precise manner
%Gof such investigations must be clearly specified in a method
%Gsection. The paragraph on source criticism must critically
%Gdiscuss these approaches.
%G
%GUsually however, there are always relevant related research.
%GIf not about the actual research questions, there is certainly
%Gimportant information about the domain under study.
%G
%G\section{The work in a wider context}
%G\label{sec:work-wider-context}
%G
%GThere must be a section discussing ethical and societal
%Gaspects related to the work. This is important for the authors
%Gto demonstrate a professional maturity and also for achieving
%Gthe education goals. If the work, for some reason, completely
%Glacks a connection to ethical or societal aspects this must be
%Gexplicitly stated and justified in the section Delimitations in
%Gthe introduction chapter.
%G
%GIn the discussion chapter, one must explicitly refer to sources
%Grelevant to the discussion.
