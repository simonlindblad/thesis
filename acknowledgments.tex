Thank you to Sectra for giving me the opportunity to do my thesis work at your organization.
Especially to Michael Nilsson and Erik Sjöblom for providing me with help to figure out the different aspects of my work.
I also want to thank Marco Kuhlmann and Arne Jönsson, my supervisor and examiner at Linköping University, for helping me with the structure and schedule, as well as discussing technical approaches.
And thanks to Josef Fagerström for providing thorough feedback on my report.
